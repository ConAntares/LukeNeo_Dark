# Title

## Subtitle 1

This is a field about Physics. Maybe I will write in Chinese, perhaps in English, because this field is used to collect and express thoughts.

* To Einstein, it was very obvious that nature would not design a system, in which mechanical laws are the same, but laws of electricity are different.
